## General Information
- As part of finance company, lending loans to customers is the primary aim of the company. When the loan applications are received, thorough background verification is done to make sure the profile is meeting the eligibilty requirements. And based on the applicant's profile, the loan request is either approved or rejected. But this decision needs to be taken carefully as there are risks involved to the business.
	If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then for some reason, if request is rejected, then it is a loss of business to the company.
	Whereas, If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, then if the request is accepted, then it is a financial loss to the company. 
Hence, company has to make wise decision before approving/rejecting the loan requests.
- Background - To determine the driver factors/variables that affect the number of defaulters
- Business Probem -  Using EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. To identify patterns which is used for taking actions to deny/approve the loan, reduce the amount of loan, or lending at a high interest rate, etc,.
- Dataset - The dataset given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
